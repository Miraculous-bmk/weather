      Flask Weather API
This is a simple Flask application that provides an API endpoint to retrieve weather information based on the visitor's IP location.

Description
The application fetches the visitor's IP address, determines their city using the ip2geotools library, and then retrieves the current temperature for that city from OpenWeatherMap's API. It responds with a JSON object containing the visitor's IP, their city, and a personalized greeting including the current temperature.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Environment Variables:
You need to set the OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenWeatherMap API key. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap, and set it using:

arduino
Copy code
export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
Usage
Run the Application:
Start the Flask server by running:

Copy code
python app.py
The server will start on http://localhost:8080.

Access the API:
You can access the API endpoint at:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/api/hello
Replace <name> with the visitor's name you want to greet.
